# Performance
This performance performance system has the functionality to clean and speed up the operating system and complete the following functions:

1) Free up ram memory
2) Clean temporary files
3) Clean windows registry
4) Clean the RUN registry key from the registry so that it does not start any malicious software or script.

And finally the credits.

[NOTE]

â€¢ I will continue improving the software so that with just one click you can clean both Windows and viruses.
